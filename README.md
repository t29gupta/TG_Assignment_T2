# TG_Assignment_T2
- Get hotels rate list filtered by hotel id and arrival date
- It's a Web API project
- Framework is .Net5

## Prerequisites:
1. Visual Studio 2019
2. .Net5 installed

## How to run:
1. Open the solution
2. Run the default Web API project by the name TG_Task3
3. Swagger page will open in browser
4. Try out the API with various input values.
5. Filtered list is returned as Json

## Run Unit tests:
1. Go to TG_Task3.Tests project

## My Approach:
I'm first filtering the list by hotelId and then By ArrivalDate. By doing this I'm able to return a moer accurate result that in case of Not Found.
